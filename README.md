| What we have learned    | - Reactive programming definition<br>- History of reactive programming<br>- The reasons why reactive programming should be implemented<br>- Example of frameworks that can be used for reactive programming<br>- [Hands-on to implement reactive programming in Android project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TXSAKHn9WIivv0sZnND3dDmjCPgbQdbeHdUbFXCm-E8)|

>Reactive programming can be implemented not only in Android, but in general software development also. There are also many libraries/frameworks to use reactive programming right away, like Rx, bacon.js, RAX. I hope from this short session, we can try and implement reactive programming in our projects. Start by little and train everyday, it will make our programming skill better.
